FightIt is a small project I have written to simulate two armies fighting. I have tried to add explanation 
to all major methods and variables of the classes. I hope that helps. But, following is the overview of how it can be tested.
The program expects following sequence of input -
	1. Name of Army 1
	2. Name of Army 2
	3. Sequence of soldiers for Army 1
	4. Sequence of soldiers for Army 2
	
The sequence of soldiers needs to be a comma separated list containing one or multiple characters of
C (Cavalry), I(Infantry) and/or A(Artillery)
The program generates the two armies with the given soldier sequence and simulates a battle between them. The armies take turns 
to attack one another in the battle. After every attack, the program prints the current stats of both the armies. 
Battle complete if either of the armies wins or if the battle is a tie. The program prints the name of the winning army
and takes user input to either generate a new battle or quit.
